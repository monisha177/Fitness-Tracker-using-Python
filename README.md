This Project is all about implementation of fitness tracker using python
# Fitness Tracker

## Overview
The **Fitness Tracker** is a project that helps users monitor their fitness by tracking calories burned during exercise. It uses machine learning to predict calorie consumption based on age, weight, exercise duration, and heart rate.

## Features
- Tracks fitness metrics like calories burned
- Uses machine learning for predictions
- Visualizes data with charts and graphs

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Plotly for visualizations

## Dataset
The project uses two CSV files:
1. **calories.csv** - User ID and calories burned
2. **exercise.csv** - User details like age, weight, heart rate, and exercise duration

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Fitness-Tracker.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open and run `fitness_tracker.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.

## Future Improvements
- Improve accuracy with deep learning
- Add a web interface for real-time tracking
